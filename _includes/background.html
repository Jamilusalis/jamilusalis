        <p>Being a full-stack web developer, my goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under
            the hood while providing engaging, adaptive, eye-candy user experiences. On the other hand, community gives
            me a platform to share complementary ideas with my peers and accelerate the process of crafting better solutions
